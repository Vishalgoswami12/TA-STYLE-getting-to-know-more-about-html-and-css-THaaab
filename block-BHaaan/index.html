            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
            pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete

            pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
            blame

            , when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents
            our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
            welcomed and every pain avoided.
